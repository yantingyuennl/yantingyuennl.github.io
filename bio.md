I was born in Hong Kong, China. When I was 6 years old, my parents moved to Europe, to open a Chinese restaurant in the Netherlands. There, in the small city of Maastricht, I grew up, wondering why my parents hadn’t decided for Paris, as they originally intended. Flash forward and I graduated from the University of Amsterdam with a masters degree in Communication Sciences.

In the end I became a documentary film maker, not a restaurant owner.

I like telling stories. Stories that make you laugh, stories that make you cry. The stories that I like to see myself in the cinema, or on TV, binging away. Those are the stories I like to tell. My films have been broadcasted and screened in both national and international theatres.
